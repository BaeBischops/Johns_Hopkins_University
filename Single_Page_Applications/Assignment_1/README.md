# SPA with Angular Js Module 1 Coding Assignment
===

The idea of this assignment was to create a front-end application that presents the user with a textbox where they can list comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch 🥞 🧇 🥓. Once that's entered, the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button.

### Here is how it works 🪛 🔧 🔨
If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 a response message shows up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 the message "Too much!" shows up under the textbox.
