<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

I am a data scientist with a strong background in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. My goal is to transform data into actionable insights and empower organizations to make informed decisions. Throughout my Data Science Specialization, I have acquired a diverse skill set and practical experience that I apply to real-world problems.

Projects
Project 1: Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn
Link to Project 1

In this project, I applied machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business. I used Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to build a model that reduced churn rates by 15%.

Project 2: Text Sentiment Analysis
Link to Project 2

I developed a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques to analyze user feedback and social media posts. The model achieved an 85% accuracy rate, providing valuable insights for improving customer satisfaction.

Project 3: Stock Price Prediction
